XKCD Reader
=====================

Simple XKCD reader made using ionic framework.

To run on Android: copy HelloCordova-debug.apk to your phone and install
To build yourself: make sure you have the android sdk installed, as well as ionic (npm install -g ionic) and run 'ionic build android'.

I've done my best to comment all code :-)
